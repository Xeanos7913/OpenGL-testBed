# OpenGL-testBed
A simple OpenGL graphics engine, with easily customizable render pipeline.

## STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT

## Future plans:
1. cloth simulator
2. better ECS
3. multithreaded rendering
4. animation loading
5. animation creating
6. compute shader abstraction (will just use my other compute library, vkgpu.hpp for compute shaders with vulkan.)
